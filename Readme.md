# Quiz Helper

Quiz Helper is a Python-based tool designed to assist with multiple-choice quizzes by automatically analyzing screenshots of quiz questions and highlighting correct answers with green checkmarks. It leverages the Gemini API for answer detection and Tesseract OCR for locating answers on the screen. The tool is activated via keyboard shortcuts, making it seamless to use during online or desktop-based quizzes.

## Features
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Captures a screenshot of the quiz and sends it to the Gemini API to identify all questions and their correct answers.
- **Answer Highlighting**: Displays green checkmarks over the correct answer options using a Tkinter-based overlay.
- **OCR Integration**: Uses Tesseract OCR to locate answer positions on the screen for precise checkmark placement.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Press `Ctrl` to analyze the quiz and display checkmarks, and `Esc` to exit the program.
- **Multi-Question Support**: Handles multiple questions in a single screenshot, displaying checkmarks for each correct answer.
- **Fallback Display**: If an answerâ€™s position isnâ€™t found, it shows the answer text alongside a checkmark at a default position.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Tested on Linux (Ubuntu or similar). Windows and macOS may require adjustments.
- **Tesseract OCR**: Required for answer position detection.
- **Gemini API Key**: Obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) for quiz analysis.
- **Python 3.12**: Ensure Python 3.12 or later is installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-helper.git
   cd quiz-helper
   ```

2. **Install Tesseract OCR**:
   On Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Gemini API Key**:
   - Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"` in `quiz_overlay.py` with your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.

5. **Create a Checkmark Image**:
   The program requires a `checkmark.png` with a transparent background. Generate one:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
   img = Image.new("RGBA", (50, 50), (0, 0, 0, 0))
   draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
   draw.line((10, 25, 20, 35), fill="green", width=5)
   draw.line((20, 35, 40, 15), fill="green", width=5)
   img.save("checkmark.png")
   ```
   Save `checkmark.png` in the project directory.

6. **Fix Tkinter (if needed)**:
   If you encounter `ImageTk` errors, install Tkinter:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-tk
   pip install --force-reinstall pillow
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 quiz_overlay.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Tool**:
   - Display a quiz on your screen (e.g., in a browser or document).
   - Press `Ctrl` to capture a screenshot, query the Gemini API, and display green checkmarks over correct answers.
   - If an answerâ€™s position isnâ€™t found, it appears with the answer text at a default position.
   - Press `Esc` to exit.

3. **Example Output**:
   ```
   ðŸ“š Quiz Helper running.
   - Press 'ctrl' to query answers for all questions in the screenshot
   - Press 'esc' to quit
   - Checkmarks will appear at answer positions
   - If an answer can't be located, it will show at the side with text
   Capturing screenshot...
   Querying Gemini API for answers...
   Found 1 question(s):
   Q1: H2O
   Finding answer positions...
   Displaying checkmarks...
   ```

## Dependencies
- `pyautogui`: For screenshot capture.
- `pynput`: For keyboard event detection.
- `pillow`: For image processing.
- `pytesseract`: For OCR to locate answers.
- `requests`: For Gemini API calls.

See `requirements.txt` for version details.

## Notes
- **Gemini API**: Ensure your API key is valid and the model (`gemini-2.0-flash`) supports image analysis. Verify available models:
  ```bash
  curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
  ```
- **OCR Accuracy**: Tesseract OCR may struggle with complex layouts or small fonts. Ensure quiz text is clear and large.
- **Tkinter Issues**: If `ImageTk` errors persist, consider switching to a Pygame-based overlay (contact the maintainer for assistance).
- **Answer Positioning**: The OCR-based positioning may need tuning for specific quiz formats. Adjust the `find_answer_positions` function if needed.
